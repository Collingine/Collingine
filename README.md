💬 About me

I've been an active 3D and engine developer for almost 20 years (mostly managing engine teams). At ☀️ day I am a co-founder of the game platform Sceneri and drive the content and business arm of the company. At 🌑 night and during 🏖️ weekends I mostly enjoy a decent round of golf or catching some sports 😄 as I am a basketball and football fan.
